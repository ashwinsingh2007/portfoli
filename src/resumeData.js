  aboutme: `I like JavaScript and everything web. When my dev senses kick-in I build presumably awesome stuff. I stay close to the community and try to keep tabs with the pace at which the web is evolving. I also like to blog what I learn.
    React-Redux, Node.js, Docker, Google cloud are the main tricks up my sleeve. I am also obsessed with making the web look pretty with SASS/CSS.
    I am a self taught Full Stack Web Developer, currently diving deeper into Machine Learning. 
    I believe that to be successful in life, one needs to be obsessive with their dreams and keep working towards them.`,
